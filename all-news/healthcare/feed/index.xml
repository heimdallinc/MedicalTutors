</div></div>



<p>To further establish its commitment to making quality health care affordable for all Nigerians, the Nigeria State Health Investment Project (NSHIP) has improved access to cheaper health care services especially for rural dwellers in Taraba State.</p>



<p>So far, its efforts have yielded positive results as the programme currently boasts of covering 47 percent of the populace.</p>



<p>According to a report released by the Guardian, the World Bank Project, which commenced its operation in the state in 2017, with Ardo-Kola local council serving a focal point, has so far brought quality and affordable health care services to the people.</p>



<p>While briefing journalist yesterday in Jalingo on the strides being made by the scheme, Project Coordinator, Dr. Ezekiel Ubanus, stated that the project was aimed at improving the delivery and use of high impact maternal and child health services.</p>
